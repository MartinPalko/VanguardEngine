# VanguardEngine
A small (for now) game engine, created for fun and learning.

## How to Compile

### Windows

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio (Tested on 2013)

Run "CreateProjectFiles.bat", found in the root directory. This will have CMake create a solution in the Intermediate/ProjectFiles directory. Open "Vanguard.sln" and it should all compile. Binaries will be output to the Bin folder in the root Vanguard directory.
